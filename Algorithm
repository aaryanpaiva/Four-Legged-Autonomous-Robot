The algorithm for this robot can be summarized as follows:

1. Include necessary libraries and define global variables:
      - Include the VarSpeedServo library.
      - Declare VarSpeedServo objects for the various servo motors.
      - Declare variables for ultrasonic sensor pins and distance measurement.

2. In the setup function:
      - Initialize the serial communication.
      - Attach each servo motor to its corresponding pin.
      - Call the stand function to set the initial position.
      - Set up the pins for the ultrasonic sensor.

3. In the loop function:
      - Move the robot's head servo to three different positions (0, 90, and 180 degrees) and measure distances using the ultrasonic sensor.
      - Store the distances in variables d1, d2, and d3.

4. Check for obstacles:
      - If all three distance readings are greater than 10 cm (indicating no obstacles in front of the robot): 
        - Compare the distances to decide the direction to move.
        - If d1 is the largest, perform a right turn (twice).
        - If d2 is the largest, walk straight (twice).
        - Otherwise, perform a left turn (twice).
      - If any of the distance readings are less than or equal to 10 cm (indicating an obstacle in front of the robot):
        - Call the stand function to stop the robot.

5. The ultrasonic_read function:

      - Triggers the ultrasonic sensor, measures the duration of the echo, and calculates the distance in centimeters.

6. The stand function:
      - Set all leg servos to a standard standing position.
      - Set the head servo to its default position.

7. The walk function:
      - Move the leg servos to simulate a walking motion in the robot.
      - Adjust the body and leg servos to create a walking gait.

8. The left_turn and right_turn functions:
      - Move the leg servos to simulate turning motions in the robot.
      - Adjust the body and leg servos to create turning motions in the robot.

This algorithm controls the robot's behavior by making it turn, walk, or stand based on the readings from the ultrasonic sensor.
It also defines the initial positions for the servos in the stand function.
